<p>The researchers were able to rule out some agricultural methane sources of methane by looking at the gas&rsquo; signatures. By looking at the distinct signatures, the researchers could differentiate between methane produced from fracking, for instance, and methane produced from agriculture because they each have different signatures.The data also suggested that the increase in methane came from regions including India, China, and Southeast Asia, suggesting that the rise was due to agriculture, not the growth of fracking in North America.&ldquo;That was a real surprise because around 2006 the U.S. started fracking and in that time the mining industry&nbsp;in Asia picked up.</p>
